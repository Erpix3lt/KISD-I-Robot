## How to run the script
Create a new env: `python3 -m venv env_i_robot`

Activate the env: `source env_i_robot/bin/activate`

Now we can use python and pip as usual.

Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Copy the .env.template file and name it .env, fill in all connection details. The default port is 1883.

Run the script via: `python3 bounce-ball.py`

Type `exit` in the venv to exit.

## How to run the detection script?
In your console navigate to the detection folder inside code: `cd code/detection`

Create a new env: `python3 -m venv env_i_robot`

Activate the env: `source env_i_robot/bin/activate`

Now we can use python and pip as usual.

Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

By standard it checks for cars in 2car.png. You might want to add your own image to assets and configure the path inside detection.py to check for cars in the newly added image.

## Architecture
Inside the code folder there a the following subdirectories: interface, tests. Alongside is the main file bounce_ball.py

**interface** The goal of the interface file is to provide all the basic functionality to communicate with the robot. 
There will also be additional functionality and helper functions.

**tests** The test folder contains both mockup and real-world tests.

**bounce_Ball.py** As of now this is our main file, it simulates a bouncing ball, sending the simulated positions to the robot itself.

## How to run UR3 virtual box
- download and install https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html
- unzip and run  https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ur-support-site/213149/URSim_VIRTUAL-5.12.6.1102099.rar

## Learnings
- p in front of list returns position
- get_actual_tcp_pose() returns actual position
- ur3/set/cmd - getJoints to return position in MQTT

## Update Raspberry and UR Simulation
### Raspberry
- Login credentials are **USERNAME: urpi** and **PW: urpi**
- navigate to mqtt-ur3-bridge
- Delete current changes -> `git stash`
- Pull all the newest changes -> `git pullÂ´
- restart the raspberry pi

### UR Simulation
- Navigate to program files folder (storing our urscript files)
- download the newest version from urscript folder https://gitlab.rlp.net/kitegg/public/kisd/mqtt-ur3-bridge/-/tree/auto-backup/src/urscript/auto-backup/mqtt-ur3-bridge?ref_type=heads

## To Do
- Define global variable of myPose, so changes to variables stay after restarting program
- Calculate bouncing ball box
- [x] get Simulation running
